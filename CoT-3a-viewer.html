				<h1>Level Three A</h1>
				<p><strong>Introductory Note:</strong> There is one and only one wandering monster on this level. It is an 8 tall animated bronze statue, cast in the likeness of the god, Thanatos, appearing as a solid version of the Incarnation of Death, AC: 2, Move: 6, HD: 8, Damage: 2 - 16, HP: 36. In addition to its normal damage, the creature
				shoots off a paralysis ray from its eye every round. The effective range of the ray is 60 and it is 1 0 wide. Any living being hit by the ray must save vs. paralysis or be immobilized for a number of turns equal to his or her constitution subtracted from 20. The statue will attempt to destroy any living being on this level. It can be encountered in any room or in any hallway.</p>
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: This entire level was once a temple and worship area devoted to the god Thanatos. Because of this, images of Thanatos (see Rooms 9 A - 13) will appear in this entire room complex.</p>
				<div id="118" class="room">
				<p><strong>118) Great Audience Hall:</strong> This room appears to have been a meeting hall of some kind. The shaft from Room 36 comes down in the center of the 20 high ceiling. Located directly below the opening is what appears to be an ancient firepit. The floor is blackened and there is evidence of charcoal around the area. Surrounding the firepit area are dozens of wooden benches in various states of falling apart from age or dry rot. In the north and south walls are secret doors that are cleverly disguised to look
				like part of the wall. In the east and west walls are great bronze doors, 20 tall and carved with strange runes (meaningless even with <em>Read Languages</em>).</p>
				</div><div id="119" class="room">
				<p><strong>119) A Private Gallery:</strong> This room is sort of the royal opera box. The south wall of this room (facing Room 118) is transparent from this side, but opaque from Room 118. The walls are carved ornately with flowers and geometric designs. The walls are also painted in brilliant, but restful colors. Instead of rotted wooden benches, there are several ornate marble couches and seats, covered with cushions that will powder to dust if touched. There is nothing of other than historical value in here.</p>
				</div><div id="120a" class="room">
				<p><strong>120A) A Holding Area:</strong> This room contains a marble table and two or three marble chairs. They are decorated with carving and worn gilding. Several rolls of blank parchment lie about on the desk and there is a robed skeleton sprawled over the desk with a sword thrust through the ribs and sticking out the back. Around the neck of the long dead corpse is a silver skull on a silver chain. The skull has turquoise eyes and is worth 25 GP. If the figure is touched it will crumble to dust.</p>
				</div><div id="120b" class="room">
				<p><strong>120B ) A Long Past Slaughter:</strong> Lying about this cell are 21 long dead corpses of men and women in strange, but rich clothing. Each corpse will have a silver skull pendant with turquoise eyes (value 25 GP). These were all worshippers of Thanatos who sought death rather than capture by the Beast Men. They were all put to death by the man at the table who then fell on his sword. There will also be 30 pieces of random jewelry in the room, on the corpses, valued at a total of 5000 GP. The cell door is locked.</p>
				</div><div id="120c" class="room">
				<p><strong>120C) A Cruel Death by Starvation:</strong> Although the noblemen and women who worshipped Thanatos were given honorable deaths, their servants, who were most likely not worshippers of the death god, were left to die of starvation, locked in this cell. Because of this, their souls were not completely freed from the mortal plane when their bodies expired. Locked in this room are 3 Wights, 6 Skeletons. Wights: AC: 5, Move: 9, HD: 3, Damage: 1 Level Energy Drain, HP: 13, 11, 17. Skeletons: AC: 7, Move: 6, HD: 1, Damage: 1-6, HP: 3, 1, 6, 2, 8 (x2). If they sense any living beings in
				Room 120 A or B, they will animate and come out of hiding and cause the bars to burst outward, doing 1 - 4 points of damage to any living thing within 10 of them. The Undead will then begin to attack with blind fury all the living creatures they can find.</p>
				</div><div id="121" class="room">
				<p><strong>121) Sanctuary of the God of Death:</strong> The walls of this large, pillared hall are lined with jet black stone. The walls, the ceiling, the floors, the pillars, all are intensely black. Add to this a permanent <em>Darkness</em> spell throughout the chamber and you will have the the temple of Thanatos. The entire room has also been permanently <em>Silenced</em> by magic. Where there would normally be a statue, there is none, for the
				statue wanders the entire level, seeking to destroy intruders (it actually make no distinction between Beast Men and Humans. After all, an intruder is an intruder). Lying about on the floor of this room are the corpses of 5 Gnolls. They have been dead for at least a millenium. If their bones are touched, they will crumble to dust.</p>
				</div><div id="122" class="room">
				<p><strong>122) The Robing Room:</strong> In this chamber will be found the crumbling remains of the priests of Thanatos ceremonial vestments in a chest (locked, with a poison pin containing a poison that paralyzes, but does not kill. So potent is this poison that it is -2 saving throw and its effect is immediate. There is a 25% chance the victim will appear dead.) Inside the box is a golden Helm studed with black sapphires that is worth 3000 GP and a ceremonial Dagger with a carved platinum hilt valued at 1200 GP.
				The various robes and ritual costumes are all decayed with age and will be valueless. There is a body of a man in the robes of a priest lying near the door. Around his neck is the silver skull with turquoise eyes (25 GP). The front of his robes seem to have been slashed open and several ribs are broken. Lying next to the box containing the jewelry is the body of a Gnoll. If the box is touched a loud moaning will be heard and the dead body of the priest will seem to stand up and then collapse as if the animating spirit has left it. A Spectre will then form and attack. Spectre: AC: 2, Move: 15/30, HD: 6, Damage: 1-8 and 2 Levels of Energy Drain, HP: 29.</p>
				<p>Trap in North Hall: This pit will open up on a d6 roll of 1 - 2. The drop is 200 down to the third Level.</p>
				</div><div id="123" class="room">
				<p><strong>123) Cells of the Unholy Brothers:</strong> These rooms were a series of Clerical cells. Each one contains 4 rotted cots, a table of marble with a wash basin set on top of it, 3 or 4 candle sconces set into the walls and a few rotted articles of clothing. Room C has occupants.</p>
				</div><div id="123c" class="room">
				<p><strong>123C) The Shadow Knows:</strong> Set in the middle of the floor of this chamber are 3 Human skulls with gem-like eyes. Kneeling around this arrangement are the corpses of 12 men in ragged clerical robes. Each corpse will have a silver skull with turquoise eyes hanging about its neck (value 25 GP). If the room is entered, 6 shadows will rise up out of the skull arrangement and attack, AC: 7, Move: 9, HD: 2 + 2, Damage: 1 - 4 plus Drain of 1 Strength Point, HP: 12, 7, 13, 15, 9, 11. The gems in the skulls eyes are worth a total of 3000 GP. If the gem eyes are removed from the skulls, the shadows
				will disappear. Each removed eye will remove one shadow.</p>
				</div><div id="124" class="room">
				<p><strong>124) Prayer Chapel:</strong> This is a small chapel devoted to meditation and repose. The secret door in the north wall is hidden behind some remarkably intact drapes. These drapes can be used to form one suit of light-weight clothing that act as Chainmail (AC: 5) but will not impede movement. The secret door in the east wall is plastered over and hidden. Only by removing the plaster can the door be opened.</p>
				</div><div id="125" class="room">
				<p><strong>125) The Crypt of King Agamemnos:</strong> King Agamemnos was sorely wounded in the escape from the Beast Men. He died subsequently and was interred in a wing of the prayer chapel. His subjects then either found some other means of escape or committed suicide. The body of the King is laid out in state with him in his kingly apparel. Scattered about the floor is 550 GP, 1000 SP, a couple of Gold Rings (50 GP each), and a small Sceptre worth 1000 GP. Upon the Kings skeletal head is a gold Circlet with a single diamond worth 2500 GP. A swiftly carved marble plaque (it looks like the
				back of a marble serving tray) states in Thracian: Here lies Agamemnos, King of Thracia and noble servant of the gods, cut down by the arrow of a slave beast.</p>
				</div><div id="126" class="room">
				<p><strong>126) Crank and Cradle:</strong> This room houses the mechanism made of polished bronze that was magically preserved to prevent rust and corrosion. It consists of a manually operated crank, a set of strange roller apparatus (pulleys) and iron cables that attach to the drum that the crank rotates, go up to the ceiling and then down through a hole in the floor to disappear in the wisps of mist floating in up out of the hole. This machinery is what raises and lowers a sort of elevator basket from this level to the next. It is also operated by a magical device from Level 4 Room 112. The basket or elevator can not be seen through the hole since it is hidden by cloud-like mist. There is light coming up through the hole. It is much brighter than magical light, but not quite so bright as a sunny day. A ladder extends down into the hole. If it is descended, the character will find himself in a bronze cage with a crank like apparatus. The crank is used to lower the cage on the steel ropes. When lowered to Level 3 it will end up a little north west of Tree 60. The cage will be visible to all guards posted on the 3rd level and it is an almost sure thing that they will have an ambush ready.</p>
