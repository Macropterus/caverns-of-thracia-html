		<h1>Level Two</h1>
		<div id="28" class="room">
		<p><strong>28) Bridge of the Giant Gnome:</strong> Sitting on the stone bridge is what appears to be a small giant. Instead it is a giant Gnome named Grastic Hammerclay, AC: 6, HD: 5, Move: 12”, Damage: 1 - 10, Weapon: Club and Spear, HP: 26. Hammerclay is a freak and was driven from his people years ago. He is severely disturbed and intensely paranoid. He is referred to by theTribesmen (the worshippers of The Dark One) as “The Old Man of the Bridge”. The Gnome survives on snared Stirges and crayfish. He would really appreciate being given some real food and would let a party of adventurers pass by him unscathed for a weeks worth of rations. If attacked he can also function as a 4th level Illusionist (see Strategic Review, Vol. 1, No. 4) using the following spells: <em>Phantasmal Forces, Phantasmal Forces, Hypnotism,</em> and <em>Hypnotic Pattern</em>. In a sack near the wall the Gnome giant has 89 GP, 68 SP, 221 CP, a small gem worth 30 GP, and a large, rusty iron key (see below). He is willing to
		trade some of his “pretties” for more food. If wounded more than 50%, the Gnome will fling himself into the river and hide under the bridge. If his location is investigated he will whimper out “Go away!” “Leave me alone.” or “Everybody hates me.” The large, rusty, iron key in Grastic’s treasure bag is actually a master key to the cell doors in Rooms 103, 104 and Room 105 A, B, and C.<br />
		The passageway leading to the north out of this area is smoothly carved and the floor is inlaid with polished marble tiles.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="28a" class="room">
		<p><strong>28A) Slippery Edge:</strong> This is a narrow ledge leading along the river’s edge. At the location of the “A”
		the floor is extremely slippery, due to water flowing down and across the ledge. If special precautions
		are not taken, such as roping characters together or driving spikes into the walls, it is possible that
		the unlucky may plunge into the dark river. Each character passing over the slippery point must roll
		under their Dexterity -3 on a d20 or fall in the river. Note: On a roll of 20, even special precautions
		will not prevent falling in. The river is 15 feet deep and has a current of 10 feet per second. Under
		the surface of the water are jagged rocks and boulders. If characters do fall in, they will be swept
		downstream to fetch up against a rocky ledge. The trip downstream will inflict ld8 of damage unless
		the character can roll under his Dexterity on a d20. If the roll is made only ld4 of damage will
		occur. Slipping into the water but being held by rope will only inflict 1 point of damage on a roll
		of l or 2 on ld6.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="29" class="room">
		<p><strong>29) Dead Halflings:</strong> This is a run down cottage, constructed of fieldstone and roofed with straw thatch, now moldy and rotting in the high humidity. The floor of the cavern at this point is deeply covered with sand. Thrust into the sand in front of the cottage is a crude Spear. Mounted on the protruding shaft of the Spear is the clean skull of a Lizard Man. Various arcane, but crude symbols are painted
		on the brow of the skull. It is obviously a warning of some kind. To the Lizard Men who dwell throughout the caverns, this place is taboo. If they discover that it has been tampered with or entered, look out! It’s holy war with every Lizard Man fighting at a +1 hit probability to the death (they think it is some how connected with their ancestors). Inside the cottage (which is slightly ransacked and contains evidence that the worshippers of Thanatos were responsible), is a cot and a table and chair. On the cot is the dessicated corpes of a Halfling in long, tattered robes. Lying on the chest of the skeleton is an open scroll. The scroll (written in ancient Thracian, uncomprehensible without <em>Read Languages</em> spell, and only a 30% chance of being read by any character with a natural read languages ability), tells of the wonders of King Agamemno’s palace and the wonderful gardens
		that surround it deep within the earth. Various passages will refer to the “Beast Men” who serve the King and of the living trees. On the table is a wax candle that once lit, will act as a <em>Continual Light</em> spell until extinguished. It may only be re-lit 6 times. A gust of wind has a 10% chance of dousing
		the light. Around the neck of the corpse is a fish-shaped silver medallion (value 69 GP) that if taken from the cottage will attract 1-3 berserk Lizard Men each round on a d6 roll of 4- 6. AC: 5, HD: 2+ 1, Move: 6/12, Damage: 1-2/1-2/1-8, HP: Roll as necessary.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="30a" class="room">
		<p><strong>30A) Stirge Strike:</strong> This area is a natural indentation into the cavern wall. Possibly at some distant time in
		the past a tributary to the main river may have flowed from this point. Now, however, the niche is
		occupied by the shards and fragments of several ornate columns and a shattered statue to some now
		indistinguishable god. Any in-depth search of the area will reveal scattered, half-buried human bones
		and 1 or 2 weapons (a heavily tarnished and dull Bronze Sword and a Stone Mace). It is doubtful
		that this search will be made since the niche is also the dwelling place of a colony of 10 Stirges,
		AC: 7, Move: 18 “, HD: 1, Damage: 1 - 3 + Blood Drain of 1 - 4 points each round thereafter up to
		a maximum of 12 points, HP: 2 (x2), 6, 7 (x2), 8, 4, 1, 5, 3. The Stirges will be well hidden in the
		rock formations, giving them a 1 - 4 chance of a d6 of surprising the unwary.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="30b" class="room">
		<p><strong>30B) Shallow Stream:</strong> This is a shallow flow of water coming out of the rock wall. It is approximately
		5’ wide but only inches deep. Lying about the stream are the long-dead bodies of 3 Tribesmen.
		One appears to have been crushed to death. Strewn about them are 2 Spears and a Shield. In a pouch
		on the crushed man’s body is a soft leather cloth containing four 20 GP turquoise gem stones folded
		carefully in it. One of the other dead men has a Bronze Dagger with a magic looking rune carved on
		it (a good luck charm and nothing else). The small “x” located on the west bank of the streamlet
		marks the location of a Piercer, AC: 3, Move: 1”, HD: 2, Damage: 2-12, HP: 11. It will drop from
		the ceiling on any creature passing below it. The Piercer appears as a 3’ long stalactite. It is assisted
		by a pair of Stirges, AC: 7, Move: 18”, HD: 1, Damage: 1-3 + Blood Drain of 1-4 points up to 12
		each round thereafter, HP: 1, 5. Again, the Stirges are well hidden, allowing them to attack with surprise on a d6 roll of 1 - 4.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="30c" class="room">
		<p><strong>30C) Lair of the Falling Stalactites:</strong> You will not find the circle pattern in this area on the map key. It indicates the possible locations
		for a group of Piercers. The black dots mark the location of 4 of the creatures. The remaining 7 should be randomly located by
		the referee and marked upon the map as to size and placement. 11 Piercers, AC: 3, Move: 1”, HD: 1 to 4, Damage: Variable
		(see below), HP: (by size of hit dice with damage following), 1 HD: 5 (x3), Damage: l - 6; 3 HD: 6, 18 (x2), 8, 12, Damage: 3-
		18; 4 HD: 21 (x2), Damage: 4 - 24. Location of Piercers as marked on map: West Bank: 1 HD and 3 HD; East Bank: 1 HD and 4 HD.
		The Lizard Men usually pass through this area in the water and avoid any problems with the hanging menaces.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="31" class="room">
		<p><strong>31) The Lizard Encampment:</strong> The west bank of the cavern at this point is the lair of a small tribe of Lizard Men, numbering 15 (there are other members of this tribe but they are not present and are elsewhere in the caverns). This tribe owes it fealty to the Minotaur King. They are presided over by a religious leader, a Shamen, who operates as a 4th level Cleric. He can whip the Lizard Men up to a battle-frenzy (60% chance) giving the creatures + 1 hit probability. If he is killed, the Lizard Men will either (1 - 25%) run in terror, (26 - 60%) continue to fight normally, (61 - 85%) continue to fight in battle frenzy at +1 hit probability, or (86- 00%) go into berserker rage that will cause them to fight at +2 hit probability and damage and of the Lizardmenalso add half again the number of their hit points to their total since they are fighting without regards to pain (lowers AC by 3 when fighting as berserker). Lizard Shaman (G’ruk the Fish-finder), AC: 4, Armor: Skin and Shield, Move 6”/12” (swimming), HD: 4, Damage: Mace 1 -8, spells: <em>Cause Light Wounds, Cause Fear, Hold Person</em>. On his person the Shaman has a satchel that contains a Potion of Undead Control, 18 GP, 4 Sacred Rocks (useless), a mummified Human Hand, 6 Teeth of various Creatures, 4 Bags of various Powders (1 is alum, 2 and 3 are useless, 4 is a poison dust that is -1 on saving throw. Failure to save means death while a save indicates taking 1 - 8 points of damage. This is virulent poison! It may be inhaled since the full bag of dust will form a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cloud, mixed with water and taken internally for up to 5 dosages or smeared on weapons as a
		paste, 2 applications), a Set of 20 Divining Sticks, 5 or 6 Strips of dried Human Flesh and a Human Jawbone. As a last resort, the Shaman will cast the poison dust as a missile weapon creating a cloud of dust (see above) when it hits. There is a 10% chance that the bag will not burst on impact. The magic potion was obtained from the treasure trove in Room 33. About 5 Lizard Braves died obtaining this one bottle. Since then the Shaman has learned of the legend that requires human blood to obtain the treasure. “Cast the blood of man upon the troubled waters.” (False) is how the phrase goes. The Shaman has been waiting for a living human to come his way for some time (the Lizard Men usually only bring back pieces). G’ruk knows of a secret door in the north wall and has a secret Lair in Room 53 H.</p>
		<p>The composition of the rest of the Lizard Band will be as follows: 5 mercenary warriors on leave from the Minotaur’s guard, AC: 4, Armor: Skin and Shield, Move: 6” /12” (swimming), HD: 2 + 1, Weapons: Club, Damage, 1 - 8, 4 Darts, Damage: 1 - 4, HP: 12, 8, 15 (x2), 14. These Lizard Men will not turn and run if the Shaman is killed, as they are trained for battle. The 12 hit point Lizard Man has a key to the north door. If any of the humans are captured, there is a 10% chance that one of these Lizard Men will suggest taking one or more captives to the palace of the Minotaur King.</p>
		<p>The remaining 9 Lizard Men will be mixed male and female (no difference in statistics), AC: 5, Move: 6”/12” (swimming), HD: 2 + 1, Weapon: claw/claw/bite, Damage: 1 - 3/1 - 3/1 - 8. These are standard issue savage Lizard Men without weapons or extra armor. When encountered for the first time they will be devouring the corpses of several dismembered Tribesmen. There will be 1 - 4 Lizard Men in the water who will be invisible to anyone not looking for them. These Lizard Men will wait until an opportune moment to attack.<br />
		The doors to the passage leading north are of heavy oak, covered with moss and bound with weathered bronze. The doors are locked and one of the Lizard mercenaries (see above) has the key.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="32" class="room">
		<p><strong>32) Spiderweb (And Spider!):</strong> At this point in the cavern (see map), passage is blocked by an immense spiderweb that is connected to all the walls, ceiling and floor. So dense is it woven that it would take a full turn of chopping to create a single, mansized passage through it. The web will also snare any item floating on the surface of the river. Any creature with 18 or greater strength can break free, if entrapped, in 1 melee round, a 17 strength requires 2 melee rounds, etc. Hidden in a shadowy niche in the cavern ceiling is the giant spider, AC: 4, Move: 3”/12” (in web), HD: 4 + 4, Weapon: Bite, Damage: 2 - 8 + poison, save or die. Near the spider and visible from the cavern floor is a large leathery sack of spider silk containing her foul offspring. Unless cut open, there is a 05% chance that the egg sack will burst open, unleashing a torrent of mouse and rat-sized baby spiders. Most
		of the youngsters will busy themselves with eating each other, but 10 - 100 will attack something else, adventurers most likely. Each baby spider has 1 - 2 hit points and is AC: 7. They will attack visciously as 1 - 1 hit die creatures and do I point of damage + inject a small dose of poison. Each time a character is bitten by one of these little creatures, a save vs. poison must be made. However, due to their small size, the character may take half his constitution and subtract it from the number
		needed to save. He then must roll over that number or die (probably from an allergic reaction). Each additional time that a character is bitten, the roll must be made, except that the number needed to save increases by one point each time and may even become greater than the original base number if a character is bitten and saves often enough.</p>
		<p>One may well ask what a giant spider’s lair is doing so close to the lair of the Lizard Men. Well,
		it’s more a case of mutual toleration than anything else. The Lizard Men feed the spider an occasional
		living Tribesman, and the spider lets them pass beneath her web without interference.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="33" class="room">
		<p><strong>33) A Seemingly Abandoned Treasure Vault:</strong> This is a dark little vault carved into the stone. The walls are painted with images of huge fanged mouths. It appears that the vault has been entered recently and the dust that has settled on the floor over the ages has been disturbed. There are dark stains along the floor in the hall leading to the north out of the room. The north hall is also slightly damp.
		The constant gurgling of water can be heard from Room 34. In the vault itself are 3 boxes, 1 large and 2 small. The small box on the right of the large box is open and empty (both small boxes are approximately the same size as shoe boxes). The small box on the left and the large box are both locked and sealed with wax seals. In the small box is a Potion of Invisibility and a +1 Dagger with a solid Garnet hilt and an apparent jewelry value of 1200 GP. The box is protected or more correctly
		“haunted” by a spectral, disembodied mouthful of sharp teeth. The mouth will bite any hand that is thrust into the box (it is invisible) and then appear for 3 melee rounds, darting in and about biting at will. If not destroyed in the initial encounter the creature will disappear, to reappear 5 - 10 rounds later. It will gain 4 hit points each time it disappears and instead of biting for 1- 4 points of
		damage it will bite for 1 - 6. Then, when it appears a third time (with an additional 4 hit points), it will bite for 1 - 8 points of damage and so on. It will continue to attack in this fashion (appearing every 5- 10 turns and attacking for 1-3 melee rounds, then disappearing for another 5 - 10 rounds) until it is destroyed or the treasure it was guarding is discarded.</p>
		<p>Disembodied Mouth: AC: 0, Move: 24, HD: Variable, but starts at 3, then goes up 1 each time it reappears, Weapon: Bite, Damage: Variable, starts at 1 -4, but each time it reappears it goes to the next larger dice size. Once d20 is reached the next attack will be at ld20 + ld4, and so on, HP: Variable, but starts at 8 hit points and goes up by 4 hit points each time it reappears.</p>
		<p>The Disembodied Mouth is an enchanted creature and may be defended against with <em>Protection from Evil</em>. A <em>Dispel Magic</em> spell will destroy it, however, it is allowed a saving throw. It can not be <em>charmed</em> or <em>slept</em>. The creature will attack the first time for three melee rounds and then disappear
		for 5 - 10 turns, reappearing and attacking for 1 - 3 melee rounds then disappear again and so on. If not destroyed soon, it gets very nasty, very quickly.</p>
		<p>The large box is protected in a similar fashion to the small box on its left. It contains a disembodied mouth which will attack in exactly the same fashion as the one in the smaller container. The large box is approximately 3’ square and 2’ tall. It contains 10 bags with 100 GP each (1000 GP total), a + 1 Shield that is decorated with a silver and platinum tracery and studded with 70 carnelians. It has an apparent jewelry value of 170 GP. However this will be reduced by 100 GP each time it
		is used in melee. There is a non-intelligent + 1 Sword and Sheath; a 50 GP silver Mirror; a 900 GP Iron Axe, studded with green glass and jade; a 140 GP gold Brooch; and a 100 GP Anklet of solid obsidian with intricate designs inlaid into it in an unknown alloy and electrum.</p>
		<p>At this point, most adventurers are ready to relax, having obtained the treasure, however, they have not yet tangled with the real guardian beast (see Room 34 ). 2 - 7 melee rounds after the large chest is opened, 1 - 2 armored tentacles will come snaking in through the north corridor and
		begin to attack.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="34" class="room">
		<p><strong>34) Great Grasping Guardians:</strong> Usually dormant, this creature lies beneath the bubbling waters which are the source of the river. If the treasure in Room 33 is disturbed (see above) then it will begin to attack by sending The Guardian Beast, AC: 3, Move: 18”, HD: 6, Weapon: Tentacles, Damage: 1-8, HP: See Below. The guardian is a variation on the octopus theme. The creature has 6 tentacles, all armored and 50’ long. The body of the beast takes 30 hit points and each tentacle takes 20. Tentacles hits may be regenerated at a rate of 3 points per turn if the wounded appendage is withdrawn from combat. Hits to the body can not be regenerated. A single blow of 10+ points of damage will sever that tentacle entirely and it will be immediately withdrawn from melee and will not be used for at least 15 rounds. When a tentacle has taken 20 points of damage it will by automatically withdrawn from the fracas. The body of the creature is always submerged beneath the water. It sees by using the eyes on the ends of its appendages. Blinking an eye does not blind that appendage,
		but blinding all eyes will functionally blind the beast. The creature attacks by using its crushing tentacles to wrap around victims and crush them to death. Once a victim is latched onto the creature gains an automatic hit of 1 - 8 on subsequent rounds until the victim is freed by destroying the tentacle. To complicate matters, the victim will be dragged at a rate of 20’ per round toward the water. A victim may survive underwater without breathing a number of melee rounds equal to his constitution divided by 4 (drop fractions). At that point he or she suffers death by drowning. Also remember that non-magical armor is incredibly heavy in the water. There is a 50% chance that a victim entrapped by the guardian beast will have his Sword or weapon arm impaired and will be unable to escape unaided. If the creature is slain, it will rise to the surface and slowly float downstream to be trapped in the spider’s web (if it still exists). The creature has a single eye that is formed of a huge jelly-like gem stone that will dry and harden and shrink into a 3000 GP diamond.</p>
		<p>The bubbling pool that is the source of the river is very, very deep. The water rises up through a pipe or shaft that extends far into the depths of the earth. It can not be traversed by swimming. Up through it, come the escape pods from Level 3 (see Room 117).</p>
		</div>
		<div id="35" class="room">
		<p><strong>35) Hall of the Sphinx:</strong> The hall leading north between area 28 and Room 35 has an inlaid marble floor of pearly gray stone. The walls are constructed of panels of marble. Each panel is 5’ wide and 15’ tall. In the center of each panel and about 5’ off the ground is a Human skull that is set into the stone. The hall is illumed in dim green light that seems to emanate from the eyes of the skulls. If any of the skulls are touched, a low chuckling laughter can be heard (<em>Magic Mouth</em>). The secret door on the west wall is disguised as a normal section of wall. To open the door, both skulls on the door panels must be pressed simultaneously. There is a 40% chance that either skull will try to bite the hand that is touching it (as 1 hit die monster) for 1 - 2 points of damage. Again the low, chuckling laughter will be audible.</p>
		<p>From the hallway, Room 35 appears to be dark and empty. The only distinguishing feature will be the 7’ high, 10’ x 15’ pedestle at the north end of the chamber. The ceiling in this room is 40’ high and barrel (circular) vaulted. The walls appear blank. Once the room is entered, the situation changes. A near-blinding column of golden light is shining directly down on the pedestle. None
		of the light directly touches anthing but the pedestle, but it serves to sufficiently illume the remainder of the room. The walls are decorated with ornate fresco paintings (painted plaster) showing the activities of some unknown gods and heroes. Lying upon the pedestle is a large sphinx, who has
		obviously been aware of and watching any intruders for quite some time. Sphinx (named Ontussa): AC: -1, Move: 15”/24”, HD: 8, Weapons: 2 claws, Damage: 2 - 8/2 - 8, HP: 47, Align: N, Spells (each usable once per day): <em>Detect Magic</em>, <em>Read Magic</em>, <em>Read Languages</em>, <em>Detect Invisible, Locate Object, Dispel Magic, Clairaudience, Clairvoyance</em>, <em>Remove Curse</em>, <em>Legend Lore</em>. This sphinx is also a Sage, average in 3 categories (65% chance of answering a question correctly). Whether she is right or not she will provide an answer. Being neutral, she is not in the pay of the Minotaur King. However, she does require that a fee be paid her, even if she does not answer a question. Minimum fee for a question is 100 GP. Minimum fee for entering the room is 10 GP per person. If either fee is not paid she will activate the doors which block the passage to the south and must be treated as <em>Wizard Locked</em> doors. The golden light acts as a magic absorbing field also providing <em>Protection from Normal Missiles</em> and serving to douse all natural fires. If the sphinx is killed by adventurers, she will lay a Curse on them with her dying breath that will lower one randomly determined ability (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, etc.) by 1 point. This lowering will be permanent and only rectifiable by a <em>Remove Curse</em>. Upon the death of the sphinx, the secret doors, up ’til now invisible (not by spell) will appear. They are locked and at -5% on opening by thieves. The death of the sphinx will not open the south doors. They will remain closed until the sphinx wills them to open or until her blood is smeared upon them.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="36" class="room">
		<p><strong>36) Intriguing Treasures and Deep Shafts:</strong> The hall leading to this room from Room 35 is normally lit with a magical green light. However, if the sphinx has been killed to obtain passage to this hall, then the walls will glow with a throbbing red light instead of the normal cool green. At the northern end of the hall is a statue of a lion-headed man with glowing orange eyes. He is flanked by red curtains on his left and right and to his rear. If the secret doors from Room 35 are passed through, and the hall entered by more than 10’, he will come to life. The lion man is 9’ tall, AC: 3, Move: 12”, HD: 5, Weapon: Mace, Damage: 2 - 12, HP: 32. Lodged in the chest of the statue creature is a 500 GP gem. If the walls glow green, then the gem merely makes him half immune to edged weapons allowing him to take only half damage from all cuts and thrusts. If the walls glow red, then he has the above ability plus, wherever he walks, the ground, be it stone or earth, in a 5’ radius, around him turns to 2’ deep mud for 2 melee rounds. The lion man can walk on top of the mud like it was solid earth. This creature is intelligent, but it will also fight to the death. It does not wish to preserve its life so much as it desires to protect that which lies beyond the curtains. If the gem in his chest (a 500 GP diamond) is removed or destroyed it loses all magic powers except that it will allow the bearer a +1 on all saving throws.</p>
		<p>If the curtains to Room 36 touch living flesh (not armor or clothing) they will immediately adhere to it (no saving throw) and cannot be removed except by <em>Dispel Magic</em>. The curtains may be pulled down but they can not be physically affected (cut, burned, torn, etc.) until the <em>Dispel Magic</em> has been cast. There are 3 sections of drapery (east, west and north) and each one will adhere to any living flesh until a <em>Dispel Magic</em> has been cast upon it. The height of the curtains is 15’. The width of the side curtains is 8’ and the back curtain is 16’ wide (specifics are gone into here because someone is certainly going to figure out that these things can be used as weapons or traps).</p>
		<p>This is the treasure room of the sphinx. It is lit by dim, amber light. The two most immediately obvious features of the circular room are two holes. One is 10’ wide and located in the exact center of the room. It is circular and I20’ deep. This smooth-walled shaft leads down to Room 118 on Level 3A. If a character has bare hands and feet, they will act like suction pads and he may climb down as a thief of the same level. The shaft itself is 70’ long with a final drop of 30’. The second hole is circular and 6’ in diameter. It is positioned on the north wall of the room. It is 3’ from the floor to the bottom edge of the hole. In reality this hole is a portable hole.</p>
		<p>In plain sight at the back of the portable hole is a large wooden box. It appears to be attached to the back wall of the hole. This is because there is a gravity orientation in the hole and that no matter which direction the hole faces, the bottom is “down”. So strong is this gravitational pull, that anything passing within 5’ of the hole opening (directly “over” it only) will be drawn into it as if he were falling (for 1 d6 + 1 points of falling damage, save vs. magic applicable). A character with below average strength (or less) will be unable to climb out of the hole unaided by rope or friends. Inside the box are the following: 4000 GP in IOO GP ingots and 2000 SP in coin, an ornate Stone Axe worth 150 GP, a 300 GP Ring of electrum and a 1200 GP heavy platinum Chain. Also a Helm of Telepathy. The box itself is locked. Smashing the lock will fracture the Helm, making it worthless.</p>

		<p><strong>37) Frost Vault:</strong> This room is in a section of the caverns that has not been rediscovered or opened in at least a millenium (1000 years). If approached from the east hall, the door seems to be a part of the blank, stone wall. However, if the wall is felt, the 5’ section that is the door will be 20 to 30
		degrees (Fahrenheit) colder than the rest of the wall. Each character feeling the wall or touching the wall at that particular point must save against magic or lose 1 energy level. The door is actually a living creature of some foul kind and it has not eaten for a long, long time. The door creature is
		AC: 2, HD: 4, Damage: Touch Drains One Life Level, HP: 22. It is of the chaotic evil alignment. After the second melee round when it is touched or attacked, the door will start spewing forth a frosty vapor from beneath it that will <em>charm</em> any living creature touched by it at +2 saving throw. The charmed creature will then seek to embrace the door until it or the door is destroyed. The vapor cloud will travel at the rate of 10’ per melee round up to a distance of 40’ in any direction. The vapor, being intensely cold, will negate any <em>Infravision</em> into or out of its area of effect.</p>
		<p>In Room 37 itself, the door creature is invisible or at least appears to be a part of the wall. The room is thickly coated in a layer of frost and snow is 1 - 2’ deep about the room and also 10-20’ up into hallway 39 A. Lying frozen on the floor are two bodies. One is a man and the other a woman. They are Thracian fighters. Both are dressed in body-fitting Platemail of odd design and wear plumed helmets. The man is dead, but if the female is taken from the room she will revive. Since she
		speaks ancient Thracian, of which there is no known surviving tongue (as far as the character’s may know). The language of the Tribesmen is a form of ancient Thracian. A Tribesman would be able to basically understand what the fighting woman is saying and vice versa. If the adventurers use a Tribesman interpreter to talk with this woman the following may result:</p>
		<p>Determine the intelligence of the interpreter and subtract the score from 14 (a positive remainder indicates a greater difficulty in understanding the language, whereas a negative remainder would indicate an ease of translation). Then, go to the chart below and roll each time a verbal interchange
		is made between the Tribesman interpreter and the Thracian fighting woman, adding the remainder to the die roll of a d20. Based on the die roll, the referee may determine the outcome of a given conversation.</p>

		<p>Epicaste, Fighting Woman, Align: Lawful Good, Level 3, AC: -2, HD: 3, Armor: +1 magic Plate Armor and non-magic Shield, Weapon: Longsword, HP: 21, STR: 14, INT: 14, WIS: 10, DEX: 17, CON: 16, CHA: 13. Epicaste is a fighting woman in the service of her King, Agamemnos, who has been dead for at least 1100 years. The last thing that she remembers is coming down into this room via the trap door in Room 39 with 3 other soldiers. She and Danaus (the dead man) must have been affected by something in the room. She will vaguely remember a cold mist. Danaus can be found lying in front of the door creature. Epicaste will say that the reason they were down here was that they were investigating the possible hiding places where the Beast Men could be headquartering. There are rumors that they are planning an uprise (unless it is made clear to her that over a millenium has passed since she and her companion were overcome, Epicaste will be adamant that only hours could have gone by since she lost consciousness. Epicaste will know her way through the northern part of the 2nd level (Rooms 31, 38, 39, 39A, 42 - 47), Rooms 1 - 8 of the 1st level, the north
		wing of the palace on the 3rd level and all of the dungeon on the 4th level. However, she will not know of their present occupants and she will not know of any secret doors (past or present). If any character can speak in the Gnollic tongue (Beast Men), Epicaste may communicate with them as per the interpreting chart. To see if the intent or meaning of a phrase is understood, follow the direction for the chart, the person trying to understand the phrase operating as the interpreter. If no adventurer speaks Thracian, the language of the Tribesmen, or Gnollic, then communication will be possible only via hand signals or a variation of <em>Read Languages</em> (Epicaste is 65% capable of writing legibly in her own tongue).</p>
		<p>Epicaste’s armor will not fit a male character nor will it fit a character taller or shorter than the 5’ 2” to 5’ 5” height range.</p>
		<p>Danaus’ armor is not magic but it will fit any character of 13 - 16 Strength and 5’ 6” to 5’ 9” tall.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="38" class="room">
		<p><strong>38) Gnoll Guardpost:</strong> Barracked in this room are 8 Gnoll warriors (one will not be in the room for he is standing guard in Room 39). The Gnolls: AC: 5, Move: 9”, HD: 2, Weapon and HP: See Below.</p>
		<p>Grotch (leader): Two-handed Sword, HP: 15; 9 SP, 7 GP.</p>
		<p>Vredd (2nd in command): Two-handed Sword, HP: I5; 6 SP, 8 GP.</p>
		<p>Gnoll l: Morning Star, HP: 8; 7 SP, 5 GP.</p>
		<p>Gnoll 2: Two-handed Sword, HP: 12; 2 SP, 4 GP.</p>
		<p>Gnoll 3: Battle Axe, HP: 11; 7 SP, 5 GP.</p>
		<p>Gnoll 4: Longbow and Battle Axe, HP: 12; 10 SP, 2 GP.</p>
		<p>Gnoll 5: Two-handed Sword, HP: 5; 4 SP, 6 GP.</p>
		<p>Human slave named Grassus (Tribesman): AC: 9, HD: 1, HP: 2.</p>
		<p>The room is filthy with offal, food scraps, bits of armor, scraps of leather, broken weapons
		(useless), discarded boxes, broken furniture, shreds of cloth, various nameless disgusting pieces of
		assorted garbage and a motley collection of disconnected bones. The human slave will be of no assistance to adventurers in combat, since he is rather dull-witted and scared of his masters. He was captured by the Gnolls as a child from his home village almost 30 years ago and speaks only the Gnollic tongue.</p>
		<p>The letter “a” in the room represents a spy-hole in the wall looking in on the stairwell. There is a 75% probability that one of the Gnolls will be at this viewport and will see any movement along the stair, thus alerting the rest of the guard post. The reason for the existance of this post is to keep an eye on the Lizard Men, who are basically trustworthy but somewhat unpredictable due to the presence of the Shaman G’ruk.</p>
		<p>If necessary, both doors in this room can be bolted with a heavy oaken bar from the inside.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="39" class="room">
		<p><strong>39) A Lone Guard:</strong> Standing before the double doors to Room 38 is a single Gnoll guard, AC: 5, Move: 9, HD: 2, Weapon: Sword, HP 9. He is standing in one of the few places in the room that is not covered with heaps of garbage (some of the garbage piles are 1000 years old!). The floor itself is covered with at least a full foot of ancient compressed garbage. If the floor is sounded for hollow spaces, the 10’ square trap door marked by the large “x” on the floor will be evident. However, the large pile of garbage that covers that area must first be moved. There will be nothing of value in the garbage heaps. Reward any characters who diligently search the piles though with 1-6 SP and 1-10 CP.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="39a" class="room">
		<p><strong>39A) A Chillsome Hall:</strong> It is a 20’ drop from Room 39 to the level of this hallway. The hall itself is much
		colder than the rest of the dungeon since it leads into the frozen Room 37. The last 10 to 20’ of the hall going east are covered with 1 - 2’ of snowy frost. Where the walls are not covered by frost, very archaic almost crude wall paintings will be evident. They were created by the people who first discovered the caverns and dug much of the crypts in this area. The more advanced civilization that created King Agamemnos’ underground palace developed out of this culture. The statuary in Room
		41 will show the signs of being from the same period.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40a" class="room">
		<p><strong>40A) A Chamber of Skeletons:</strong> The secret doors in the hall leading to Room 35 open up on a short hall ending in a set of roughly carved stairs leading further in to the depths of the earth. The room they enter has a ceiling 35’ in height. The blank stone walls are lined with human skeletons. Each 5’ section of wall contains 1 skeleton (total of 20): AC: 7, Move: 6”, HD: 1, Damage: 1- 6, HP: 4.
		The eyes of the skeletons glow with an eerie orange light.</p>
		<p>A special note about the stair leading down to this room. The stairwell is filled with the ancient, but still strong, webs of a long dead giant spider, whose husk can still be found about 30’ down the stair. Passage down the stair can only be effected by somehow removing the webs. Fire is the simplest method.</p>
		<p>The west wall of the room contains a locked, 10’ wide door on the floor level and also another locked 10’ wide door 20’ above the floor (which goes to 40 C). However this upper door is <em>Illusioned</em> to appear as blank wall. This door has a 5’ wide ledge in front of it that runs the width of the room. Flanking the door on the left and right are a pair of stone gargoyles. These statues can not be chipped, broken or knocked out of place. The north wall of the ledge is a secret door (to 40 B). (Room 40 and 41 are split level on level 2.)</p>
		<p>The doors on the lower level are magicked so that anyone attempting to open them will be bitten by a variation of the <em>Magic Mouth</em> spell. Instead of an illusionary mouth appearing and speaking, a mouth filled with very sharp teeth will app	ear at the exact location that is being touched by the opener and bite for 1 - 4 points of damage (saving throw vs. magic applicable). This will occur a total of 4 times. <em>Dispel Magic</em> will remove the mouth permanently.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40b" class="room">
		<p><strong>40B) Guardian of Singular Combat:</strong> The single fighting man in this room will never be surprised. He appears to be garbed from head to toe in cunningly crafted Platemail. His face is hidden by a visor. The guardian is armed with Sword and Shield. He will fight at a minimum level of 4th or as a fighter 2 levels higher than his opponent. Guardian: AC: 2, Move: 9”, HD: 4+, Damage: 1- 8, HP: 25. The
		guardian will mentally say to any who enter: “I am the guardian. To pass me, I must be defeated and destroyed. Choose your champion.” The guardian will not attack until a single champion has been determined from intruding adventurers. If he is attacked enmasse, then the first adventurer to cross swords with him or hit him with a spell (or join combat in any manner) will be his opponent. At that point he is impervious to all attacks or attempts at hindrance by any other being. Any further attempt at touching or attacking the guardian will pass through him as if he were smoke or immaterial. The same will go for his opponent. Once locked in combat with the guardian, it is to the death. If the guardian is defeated by the adventurer, he then collapses into a pile of jumbled and rusting armor. His sword, however, remains bright and shiny since it will now function as a +1 magic blade. If the adventurer dies, (s)he has lost and the guardian will make the challenge again (see above). If at any point, the adventurers leave the room without defeating the guardian, the guardian will immediately regain all lost hit points. The door opposite the one entered will close with a <em>Wizard Lock</em> until the guardian dies.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40c" class="room">
		<p><strong>40C) The Throne Hall:</strong> This large, unlit hall is draped at the western end. A 10’ wide opening is in the 1st pair of drapes, but the curtains behind the throne are unbroken and run from ceiling to floor and wall to wall. A wall of bars with a 10’ wide door in the center will prevent intruders from approaching the throne. The gate in the bars is locked and -15% on picking due to some complicated inner workings. The bars are of iron and extremely thick.</p>
		<p>The throne itself, though somewhat crudely constructed and decorated with monster faces and strange runic symbols (even a <em>Read Languages</em> spell will make no sense of them), is apparently gold-plated (value 5000 GP). If the throne is sat in, the sitter must make a -2 saving throw vs. magic or have his alignment immediately change to chaotic evil. This change will only be apparent to the character affected. Any attempt to touch the throne other than sitting in it will paralyze the toucher
		(as per a ghoul touch, but this also includes Elves) until <em>Dispel Magic</em> or until the victim is touched by a lawful good character. When a victim is paralyzed, a glistening wetness will appear on the north wall that will form into an ochre jelly in 3 melee rounds and drop to the floor, immediately heading for the throne area and any victims. Ochre Jelly: AC: 8, Move: 3”, HD: 5, Damage: 2 - 12 , HP: 30.</p>
		<p>If the question of “What happens when a lawfully good aligned character touches the throne?” arises, the answer is that, instead of just paralyzing the victim it will also deal out alignment shock as per a magic sword, doing 2 - 12 points of damage. A maximum of 24 points of damage will be dealt out. At that point the chair will lose its ability to paralyze, change alignment and do shock damage. However, it will also then change to worthless lead (weight, 500 encumbrance points).</p>
		<p>Behind the curtains at the west end of the hall are a pair of stone doors, each carved with the face of a beneficent looking man.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40d" class="room">
		<p><strong>40D) The Crypt of the Mummy:</strong> The door to this room is locked and also closed with 2 heavy bars of strong oak. On the lock is a wax seal bearing the signet of a dead king of ancient Thracia (at least 2000 years old). Extending 10’ out from the north wall is a 5’ wide, 3’ tall stone crypt. It is featureless and has a hingeless stone lid (a 5’ x 1 0’ stone slab). Touching the crypt with anything (hand, weapon, pole, rock, etc.) will cause the slab to explode for 1 - 3 points of automatic damage to all characters within 5’ of the crypt. A tall, gaunt figure will spring up, armed with a black sword. The being is a mummified, ancient king of Thracia, doomed by his evil life to live forever. AC: 3, Move: 6”, HD: 5 + 1, Damage: 1 - 12 + Level Drain or 1 - 12 + Rotting Disease (see below), HP: 26. The mummy is armed with the magic sword “Thirster” (see below) and there is a 50% chance each round of combat that he will use it to attack with instead of just clawing. The sword is in his right hand. Thirster: This chaotic evil sword has no pluses, but instead it drains one energy level each time it hits in addition to normal sword damage. The sword has an Intelligence of 12 and an Ego of 8, speaks Chaotic, Red Dragon and Troll, detects gems, good and sloping passages, locates secret doors and endow the bearer with <em>ESP</em>. The sword may communicate telepathically with its bearer as well
		as speak in audible words. Thirster also has an idiosyncrasy of being afraid of Undead creatures. While this problem does not affect the sword directly, the phobia will be passed on to the bearer. In the presence of Undead a control roll must be made (if the bearer is not controlled by the sword already) and 4 points must be added to the sword’s ego. If the control is made by the sword, the bearer will either go berserk until restrained (50% chance) or passively withdraw and go into shock
		until the situation is removed.</p>
		<p>The bottom of the crypt is covered with 2000 GP and near the north end of the crypt is a bone scroll case. In the case is a scroll containing a single spell, <em>Limited Wish</em>. In a bottle near the south end of the crypt is a potion of longevity.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40e" class="room">
		<p><strong>40E) A Burial Vault:</strong> Buried in ancient times, the occupants of this chamber have not “fed” for millenia. Two wights haunt this room with their honor guard of 6 skeletons. Wights, AC: 5, Move: 9”, HD: 3, Damage: Level Drain, HP: 16, 17. Skeletons, AC: 6, (armed with Shield), Move: 6”, Damage: 1- 6, Weapon: Sword, HP: 1, 4 (x3), 7, 3. The room will be “deathly quiet” until the door is opened.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40f" class="room">
		<p><strong>40F) A Second Burial Vault:</strong> This vault contains a moldering, dead skeleton. However, after the room is entered, the body will animate, sit up and turn to face any intruders. It will speak in a very ancient tongue (only a <em>Read Languages</em> spell that has been previously cast will allow any understanding). It will say: “Long have I lain here, storing up my hatred for those who have entombed my brethren.
		Now they shall be unleashed on those who have wronged them!” The skeleton will then rise from its bier and begin to walk toward the door. It will not attempt to attack any being. If it is not obstructed It will tap the doors to crypts E, G, and H, releasing the Undead in there. The released Undead will then begin to attack anything in sight. Once they have defeated any living creatures, they will begin an organized assault on living creatures in the caverns. If the skeleton from this crypt is not destroyed, he can convert any dead creature (recent) into a zombie or any long dead creature into a skeleton. If this skeleton is destroyed there is a 75% chance that his imbuing spirit will be transferred to any available dead body within 200’. Skeleton: AC: 7, Move: 6”, HD: 4, Damage: 1- 6, HP: 30, Turns as a Spectre. Any Undead encountered by this creature will immediately follow it.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40g" class="room">
		<p><strong>40G) Another Burial Vault:</strong> Locked in this vault are a pair of Dopplegangers who will hide in the shadows until a chance to reveal themselves is possible. Dopplegangers: AC: 5, Move: 9”, HD: 4, Damage: 1-12, HP: 20, 23. Note that Dopplegangers are not Undead. At the south end of the room in the center of the wall, sitting on the floor, is a chest with a transparent crystal top. Visible in the top (which is about 3” thick) is a sword. The crystal is unbreakable and can only be removed from the sword by <em>Dispel Magic</em>. The sword is a -2 Cursed Sword, chaotic evil in alignment. Inside the chest itself, 3000 GP will be visible. They will cover the entire bottom of the chest. In a secret compartment, accessable from the left side of the chest will be a Potion of Speed, a Potion of Diminuation and a Clerical Scroll containing <em>Protection from Evil</em>, <em>10’ Radius</em> and <em>Sticks to Snakes</em>. The latch to this secret compartment is guarded by a cross bow trap that will fire directly beside the chest (which is immoveable, by the way) at the location that one must be in to work the latch and open the secret compartment.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40h" class="room">
		<p><strong>40H) Yes, You Guessed It! Still Another Burial Vault:</strong> However, this vault is empty. There is no body or any other item in this room. The only distinguishing feature in the room is a line of writing carved into the east wall, ledgible from 5’ or closer (i.e., the room must be entered to read the writing). The writing is in very ancient Thracian and readable only via <em>Read Languages</em>. It says: “I have been waiting for you.” If the message is said out loud or if the adventurers remain in the room more than 2 melee rounds, each adventurer will hear clearly in his mind the following: “Ahhh … .it’s been a long time! I have been waiting for you to come … ha ha ha ha ha!” At that point the door will <em>Wizard Lock</em> shut. If at least 3 spikes have been set to keep the door openable, it will take a full melee round for the door to close. A character of 18+ Strength may hold the door for 1 - 2 melee rounds. Nothing will happen to those characters sealed into the room except that they must find some way of escape before they die of suffocation or starvation. The door opens inward.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="40i" class="room">
		<p><strong>40I) Wily Water Trap:</strong> This is a trap of the nasty variety. But, it is not without a possible escape route. The room appears to be a short corridor, leading from Room 40 C to some other chamber. However, the doors at the west end leads not to another room, but to doom and destruction. Touching those doors will seal the doors at the east end with a <em>Wizard Lock</em>. Opening the west doors will release
		water from the river through a metal grate behind the doors. The force of the water will thrust the doors open and make them totally unclosable, except by a human or creature with 18 (00) Strength or better and then it will only allow a 15% chance of doing so. An attempt to close will take 3 melee rounds and the room will fill to the ceiling in 5. The ceiling is 10’ high and in this ceiling, at the location marked by the “x” on the map is a 5’ square opening. This opening is a vertical shaft or chimney that leads upwards to the 1 st level. From the ceiling of 40 I to the floor of Room 20 (see map Level 1, spot marked with “x” in Room 20), the distance is 70’. There are no handholds in the shaft except those that would be findable by a trained thief.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="41a" class="room">
		<p><strong>41A) Hall of Ancient Statuary:</strong> From the east, a set of stairs descend 10’ down into this room. The ceiling is 25’ high. The chamber is illumined by 10 glowing pillars that give off an eerie yellow-green light that seems to flicker almost like torchlight. Every 5 melee rounds the light will go out for 1 - 5 melee rounds, then flash into activity again like 10 giant strobes. This will blind any characters not
		making a saving roll against paralyzation for 1 - 2 melee rounds and eliminate the ability to see in the dark for 1 - 6 turns. Every so often a low rumble can be heard in this room. Moving about will set off noises that sound like traps being released or monsters moving about.</p>
		<p>The rectangles marked with letters represent 6’ tall pedestles, upon which sit a variety of statuary, carved from several kinds of stone.</p>
		<p>A) Sphinx - carved of porphyry (volcanic). Eyes are huge quartz spheres valued at 200 GP each.<br />
		B) Hydra, 8-headed - carved of black marble (not full sized). Eyes are of amber. Each eye valued at 25 GP.<br />
		C) Minotaur - carved of soft soapstone. The statue has jade eyes valued at 400 GP each.<br />
		D) Dryad- carved of black basalt. Eyes are small citrines valued at 50 GP each.<br />
		E) Griffon- carved of glistening white marble. Eyes are fire opals, valued at 350 GP   each.<br />
		F) Manticore - carved of black marble. Eyes are a pair of red tourmalines valued at 200 GP each.<br />
		G) Harpy - carved of green marble. Eyes are brilliant cut green emeralds valued at 400 GP each.<br />
		H) Hippogriff - carved of black lava. Pupils of the eyes are small periodots valued at 50 GP each.<br />
		I) Satyr (man with goat legs and goat horns) - carved of pink granite. Eyes are a ruby set on a diamond. Total value of each eye is 1 000 GP.<br />
		J) Centaur - carved of white marble. Eyes are aquamarines valued at 300 GP each.</p>
		<p>The statuary seem to be unguarded, but … for every 10 GP worth of gems pried out of the eyes of any statue there will be a 1% chance of summoning the guardian of the hall. This chance is cumulative and must be checked each time a new gem is pried loose (each gem will require 1 - 2 melee rounds of time to release it intact from its setting. Thus when the 100% mark is reached ( 1000 GP worth of gems) the guardian will appear regardless (see Room 41B for guardian’s statistics). In two
		melee rounds after the guardian has been summoned it will appear, bursting through the secret doors in the west wall. The creature appears as an 8’ tall black statue of a regal appearing man wearing a black crown and having flaming eyes and mouth. He will attack and pursue any being possessing the stolen gemstone eyes.</p>
		<p>The secret doors in the north wall, when searched for, will appear to be part of the wall. The secret doors in the west wall will be undetectable unless a <em>Detect Magic</em> is placed on that wall or a magical light (other than that already in the room) is shone upon them. At that point they will show a glowing out line with palm shaped areas glowing 4’ off the ground in the center of each door. The doors will open by pressing an open hand to each glowing palm.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="41b" class="room">
		<p><strong>41B) Audience Chamber of the Stone King:</strong> The stair down to this room descends 40’ from Room 41A. It is lit by a blue violet light that tends to cause drowsiness (save vs. magic or be -1 hit probability and +1 armor class for 10 melee rounds). At the base of the stairs is a large circular chamber that is lit by walls that seem to burn with a cold, violet fire. Flanking the base of the stairs is a pair of placid
		pools of water .. Every so often the pools will gurgle and a ripple will move across the surface. There is nothing down there, but who wants to test it and find out?</p>
		<p>At the west end of the chamber is a large statue. It is standing stock still. The thing is actually the guardian of Room 41A and if it is destroyed there or has even entered that room, it will not be down in here. The statue appears as a black man, 8’ tall and of regal bearing, wearing a crown set with three large, violet gems, valued at 500 GP each. The statue’s eyes and mouth burn with orange flame. He is AC: 1, Move: 9”, HD: 11, HP: 50. The guardian can not be hit by non-magic weapons
		since only weapons of + 1 or better will affect it. Edged weapons will do half damage. Lightning will do full damage and magic fire will regenerate hits upon the monster equal to the damage that it
		would normally do. Non-magic fire and no spells except <em>Rock to Mud, Stone to Flesh,</em> and <em>Disintegrate</em> will affect this monster. It will attack once per round for 2 - 12 points of damage with its fists and every other round it will spew forth a blast of fire from its eyes and mouth that will do 3 dice of damage (3- 18 points, saving throw applicable) to all creatures in a 10’ wide by 20’ long cone in front of it. The statue can not be pushed over as every step is firmly rooted to the ground.</p>
		<p>It will not attack if its room is entered. However, if the gem-eyes of the statues in Room 41A are removed (see above) or if an attempt to remove the gems from its crown is made or if the statue is attacked, it will begin to attack. This creature can detect the presence of the gems from Room 41A at any distance and will pursue and destroy any being possessing those gems to the ends of the earth.</p>
		<p>While in this room (41B) the stone king may cause the trap door in front of the stair to drop away leaving a 10’ wide gap of open water (20’ deep) between the room and the stairway, but he will not do so if he has not yet been animated.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="42" class="room">
		<p><strong>42) Rubble-filled Caverns:</strong> This is a large cavern with a stone floor. It is fairly dry and there are stalactite and stalagmite formations along the south wall only. The stair to the north leads up to Level 1. The floor of the cave is littered near the center with debris from Room 27 on the 1st level. There is a large chasm in the ceiling that connects with that room on the level above. While there are no dangerous monsters in this chamber per sec, inhabiting the rubble pile is a colony of rats. If the rubble pile is entered, they will begin to squeal and shriek. Any tloise in this cavern or any light will alert the attention of guards located at 43.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="43" class="room">
		<p><strong>43) Guard points and Pit Traps:</strong> A short stair at this point goes upward approximately 10’. In amongst the pillars are 4 Gnoll guards, each armed with Longbows and Halberds. Gnolls: AC: 5, Move: 9”, HD: 2, Damage: 1 - 6 with Bow, 1- 10 with Halberd, HP: 14, 5, 10, 11. These guards will be alerted and ready by any noise or light in cavern 42 or from the east cavern.</p>
		<p>The two pit traps are very well disguised and only a Dwarf or a Thief would be able to distinguish that they exist (if he were looking for them). The shallower pit (20’) is a normal pit. However, its bottom is filled with sharpened stakes. The pit will do 4d6 of damage to whoever falls in. This pit is of recent make and will open on a d6 roll of 1 - 3 every time it is crossed. Once the pit opens it then snaps shut again. However, its presences will then be detectable since the sand on the floor of this cavern will have been disturbed. The 30’ deep pit is extremely ancient and its location is unknown to current dungeon inhabitants. Though locked shut for 2000 years, a portion of the mechanism has corroded through allowing the trapdoor to function once again. It will only open a d 10 roll
		of 1 and when it does it will make a good deal of noise as it swiftly creaks open and snaps shut again (the mechanism hasn’t been oiled in a couple of millenia or so). Instead of being a straight shaft, the pit becomes a slide, sending victims shooting southward into room “C” of Room Complex 45. No damage will be taken by the fall. Once opened the trap door will close, jamming and wedging shut
		for eternity as the mechanism snaps. A percentage roll of 90%+ by a character of 18 (00) Strength can force it open though, although any tool used for leverage will snap after a few moments.</p>

		<div id="44" class="room">
		<p><strong>44) Statue of a Long Forgotten God:</strong> This cavern was once the shrine area of many a now forgotten god and godling of the ancient Thracian race. In this alcove is a fairly intact sculpture of a fair-looking young man. The pearly-white marble has been weathered and stained by the passage of time and water. The head is somewhat worn away by constant erosion and stalactites hang off the chin and arms. Written in ancient Thracian is the following, “Oh Apollo, blessed healer, touch me and make me whole.” If this phrase is spoken while touching the statue, a <em>Cure Light Wounds</em> spell will be cast upon the beseecher. This will only work 1 - 4 times before the ancient magic is exhausted. The walls of the alcove are of rough-carved rock with two marble bas- relief panels of acts of the god set into the living rock. One east and the other north. The east panel is actually a secret door. If the door is open, a pair of Spears will spring forth to impale the opener, being thrown as if fired by a 7th level fighting man.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45" class="room">
		<p><strong>45) The Temple of Athena …Or… The Temple of the Descension:</strong> A set of stairs leads upwards 10’ to a massive temple (Greek design) with heavy doric pillars. The base of the temple is carved with high relief sculpture panels with scenes depicting the Thracian dieties in combat with demons and sea monsters. On the east wall of the temple’s base is a secret door, disguised as a carved panel. It opens up on a narrow stair that leads down to Room Complex 45A.</p>
		<p>At the east end of the temple is a tall statue ( 10’) of a regal woman in long loose, greek style clothing. She bears a Shield and Spear and wears a Helm. The 10’ square area before the statue (marked with an “x” on the map) is a <em>Teleportation</em> pad. Standing on it for 1 melee round will activate it and send those upon the square to area 54 on the 3rd Level map (see 89 if a special marble is possessed). Guarding this strategic location is a squad of 8 Gnolls, AC: 5, Move: 9”, HD: 2, Damage: 1 - 6 with Longbow, 1 - 10 with Halberd, HP: 7 (x3), 8, 10 (x2), 9, 12. Each Gnoll will have 11 SP and 2 GP on his person. Any light or noise in the cavern will alert the Gnolls, who will hide amongst the pillars and wait until an ambush presents itself. If outnumbered or taking heavy losses, the Gnolls will retreat to the teleportation pad and seek to create another ambush on the 3rd Level with reinforcements to be found there.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Room Complex 45 A-I</h3>
		<div id="45a" class="room">
		<p><strong>45A) Weapon Storage Vault:</strong> This room is filled with about a dozen large, sealed, wooden boxes. The boxes are all in remarkably good shape.</p>
		<p>Box 1) Wrapped in oil-soaked cloth are 20 Bronze Swords. These swords are half-again as heavy as an iron sword and after 3 hits are scored with them, they will be -1 hit probability until resharpened.</p>
		<p>Box 2) Wrapped in oil-soaked cloth are 30 Spears.</p>
		<p>Box 3) Carefully wrapped up in oil-soaked cloth is a suit of Plate Armor of archaic design; Without modification, it will fit a Human of 11 - 14 Strength and 5’ 2” to 5’ 5” in height. The armor is +1.</p>
		<p>Box 4) This box is open and the contents have rusted and tarnished. It contains 30 Spears. It is 40% likely the pile of them will collapse into debris if handled.</p>
		<p>Box 5) Wrapped in oil cloth are 60 Crossbow Quarrels.</p>
		<p>Box 6, 7, 8) In these boxes are the components of a special mechanism that will throw 6 Crossbow quarrels per round for a total of 6 rounds before having to be reloaded. There are no assembly instructions and the parts, although well protected, are incomprehensible. A fighting man will have a percentage chance equal to his Intelligence score -10 x 5. If the fighting man has access to a knowledgeable Sage, his chance of constructing the machine properly will go up by 20%. If it is known how to assemble the machine, it will take a minimum of 2 turns to put it together properly. If the machine is put together and carried (weight of 1000 GP + Quarrels) it will take the averaged Dexterity of all characters doing the assembling subtracted from 20 in melee rounds to put the thing in working order and capable of firing on the next melee round. If a fighter is trying to put the machine together for the first time, subtract his Intelligence from 25 and the resultant number will be
		the number of hours required to puzzle the thing together (if he or she can do it at all). An improperly constructed machine will not work at all. Treat as Light Crossbow for accuracy.</p>
		<p>Box 9) Another box of carefully wrapped Crossbow Quarrels, 60 in number.</p>
		<p>Box 10) 4 circular Shields with the head of a bull emblazoned on them in green paint.</p>
		<p>Box 11) Another box of wrapped Crossbow Quarrels, 60 in number.</p>
		<p>Box 12) This box is differently constructed from all the rest. Completely unfamiliar writing, alien to every type of writing that the adventurers may have seen ‘til now is emblazoned on the box. It will look very much like Chinese characters, but you don’t have to tell the players this. If read by the use of a <em>Read Languages</em> spell, it will say “Wing Tu, weapon-maker for his excellency the undying Emporer.” Inside, preserved by some strange magic are some very odd weapons. Created from high grade steel are 10 star-shaped items with sharpened edges (shuriken). If the use of these is learned they will operate as throwing Daggers and do 1 - 4 points of damage each, being non-magically + 1 due to the high grade of the metal used. There are a pair of black sticks, 12” long and joined by 4” of chain (nunchaku). If the use of these is learned, they will work as morning stars and do 1 - 8 points of damage. However, if a character is not already trained in the use of the Morning Star, there is a 80% chance that any concerted use of them will do 1 - 2 points of damage to the character concerned. There is also a 40” long Sword of strange design with an extremely light and sharp blade. It will be + 1 and non-magical due to the quality of craftmanship and the high grade of steel used. The oddest item in the box are 20 tubes constructed of some type of heavy parchment and mounted on short, thin sticks (sky rockets). If lit (fuse sticks out the end with the stick) they will shoot off with a range of
		500’ and explode in a flash of bright, sparkling colors. If used as weapons, they will have the range of a short bow, but at -5 to hit. There is a 30% chance that they will explode on contact with a target for 1-6 points of damage, blinding the victim for 1-4 melee rounds in the process. If they do not explode, damage is negligible (as if they glanced off).</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45b" class="room">
		<p><strong>45B) Doors to the Hidden Tombs:</strong> These doors are not secret from this side. Written on the door in Ancient Thracian is the following inscription; “It is not given that man should interrupt the sleep of his ancestors. Do not transgress beyond this point.” These doors will not yield even to magic.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45c" class="room">
		<p><strong>45C) Demesne of the Minotaur Lizard:</strong> A large reptilian creature has been in a sort of stasis-like trance for some centuries now. Originally placed as a guard for the secret door in the north wall, it was forgotten long ago. The spell placed on it is such that if the room is entered, it will awaken and attack. Once it has defeated and devoured its victims it will fall back into the stasis again. Minotaur Lizard: AC: 3, Move: 9”, HD: 8, Damage: Bite: 4-32, Claw: 2-20, Claw: 2-20, HP:46. The secret door in the north wall is further guarded by two spells. The first is a <em>Polymorph Other</em> spell. The first creature to touch the door with the intention of opening it must make a saving throw vs magic or be polymorphed into a house cat. The second one to touch the door will be hit with a <em>Magic Missile spell</em> of 7th level.
		Thereafter the door will be safe to open, except that it is <em>Wizard Locked</em>.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45d" class="room">
		<p><strong>45D) Slippery Slide from the Trap Above:</strong> This is the slide that comes from the 30’ deep trap described in area 43. The slide is so designed that no actual damage is done in the drop. The slide is steep, but the Minotaur Lizard can climb it. The trap door cannot be opened or sprung from beneath.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45e" class="room">
		<p><strong>45E) A Sealed-Off Retreat:</strong> This was the route taken by the last human survivors of the beast-men revolution that captured the palace of King Agamemnos over 1000 years ago. The room is scorched and blasted as if a fireball had been set off in there and had set the remainder of the contents of the room on fire. The door to room 45F is barred from the other side and will be -2 on opening.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45f" class="room">
		<p><strong>45F) Chamber of Forgotten Finery:</strong> The walls of this room are covered with ornate stylized paintings of magic and sorcery. Various statues of kings and queens and goddesses line the east wall (these are real statues, honest, no tricks!). The stone doors to room 45G seem to have a sort of yellowish powder around the edges. It is really dried up yellow mold. (It does no damage but should serve as a hint).</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45g" class="room">
		<p><strong>45G) Court of Foul Fungus:</strong> If the door to this room is forced open (from either end) a 10’ x 10’ x 10’ cloud of spores will be knocked loose from the gigantic yellow mold colony that has spawned in this chamber. Any character breathing the spores must save vs poison or die. The only way to destroy this mass of putrid plant is to burn it. Physically disturbing the mold will send up a cloud of spores in the area affected. This room was once a well-equipped magical laboratory. However, now all that remains of the great lab are shattered shards of glassware and approximately 300gp worth of small gems used in experiments along with 100 GP of gold wire and 50 GP of silver wire.</p>
		<p>Both doors in this room would normally be hidden behind secret panels in the once-rich woodwork that lined this room. However, the mold has long since destroyed the wood and now covers the walls and ceiling, hiding any traces of possible doors.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45h" class="room">
		<p><strong>45H) An Empowering Globe:</strong> In the center of this small chamber is a stone table upon which sits a glass globe that glows with a golden light. On a bookshelf against the north wall are several scroll cases, totalling 5. Each one has a different color wax seal on the case.</p>
		<p>Red Seal: The seal on this scroll case is whole and unbroken. On the scroll is an inventory of magic items stored on the shelves. (The shelves are now empty.) The scroll is written in the Thracian language of the same period as King Agamemnos and the revolution.</p>
		<p>Black Seal: This unopened scroll is written in the ancient Thracian language that predates the time period of Agamemnos by about 1000 years. It describes the wondrous statues in room 41A, telling of their jeweled eyes. It does not mention any type of guardian, though.</p>
		<p>Blue Seal: This scroll has explosive runes written on it.</p>
		<p>Green Seal: This scroll is enscribed with four magic spells of the third level, <em>Fire Ball, Dispel Magic, Invisibility 10’ Radius, lnfravision.</em> A <em>Read Magic</em> spell will be required to read this scroll.</p>
		<p>Gold Seal: This seal is broken and has been resealed several times. It is a maintenance log on the globe and describes its functions.</p>
		<p>The golden globe is the source of power for the teleportation system between levels 2 and 3. If it is destroyed, the system will no longer function and any creature on the second level will be trapped until an alternate method of transportation is devised or discovered. Casting a <em>Dispel Magic</em> on the item will negate its powers for 3 turns. If the globe is broken, it will require a <em>Teleportation</em> spell and a <em>Permanent</em> spell to repair it, not to mention a new glass globe. Shattering the globe will destroy it. It is fragile and any hit will do the job. If the globe is removed from the room the teleportation unit will cease to function. The globe is 8” in diameter and is hollow.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="45i" class="room">
		<p><strong>45I) The Last Stronghold:</strong> It was in this room that the remnants of King Agamemnos’ court and guard made their escape and that their dead and mortally wounded were left. If Epicaste from room 3 7 is with a group of adventurers, she will be able to identify several of the corpses as friends and aquaintences of hers. One of the bodies in the room is not completely dead yet. Powerful magic was used to
		keep the near-dead Anteus, a soldier in the King’s Guard, alive or partially alive for 1100 years. Anteus appears as a tall (6’) man in plate armor and shield (+1 plate) bearing a two-handed sword. In addition, he has a +2 dexterity bonus. AC:-1, Move: 9”, HD: 7, Damage: 1-10 +2 (for strength), HP: 41. His vocal chords have atrophied and he has lost the power of speech. If any can speak the language of the tribesman or the Thracian tongue then he might be made to understand peaceful intentions (See room 37 for translation charts). If he is not immediately made to understand that the adventurers are not servants of the beast-men, he will attack. The small, circular room on the south wall of this room is actually a shaft that leads from room 36 to 118 (see room 36). From this point, it is 60’ up to the floor of room 36 and 40’ down to the ceiling of room 118 and an additional 20’ beyond that to the floor. Falling from this point will do 6D6 of damage.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="46" class="room">
		<p><strong>46) Giant Spider:</strong> AC: 4, Move: 3”/12” (in web), HD: 4 + 4, Damage: Bite 2-8 + save vs poison or die,
		HP: 28. Once per round this spider may also, shoot a strand of web at the victim. If the victim is hit
		he must make a saving throw of under his strength 4 on a D20. Treat each level of extraordinary
		strength as a seperate strength point.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="47" class="room">
		<p><strong>47) A Deteriorated Outer Sanctuary:</strong> The once brilliant paint is peeling off the low relief sculptures of inter-deity combat that line every wall in the temple area. The place does not appear to be in any kind of use, however, if the adventurers entering this room are determined to be enemies of the gnolls
		(an almost 100% certain possibility), they will suddenly be rained upon by 4 crossbow bolts coming from the east and west walls. The missiles are fired by gnolls (2 hit dice creatures) from light crossbows at short range. The bolts are fired out of arrow ports that have been cunningly and almost invisibly carved into the sculptured walls. Each of the four crossbows will fire once each round. The ports are not large enough for a flask of oil to be thrown through and, also, can be closed from the inside, if necessary.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="48" class="room">
		<p><strong>48) A Draped Inner Sanctuary:</strong> This room reeks of long occupancy by members of the ursine race, i.e it’s a bear lair. Lairing in this room are two trained war bears. They are brown bears with special fighting training so that they attack with a +1 and will fight to the death. AC: 6, Move: 12”, HD 5 2 claws at 1-6 each, bite for 1-8 and on paw hits of 17+ a hug for 2-12 additional points, HP 36, 44. The two bears will be assisted in winning battles by their trainers, 3 gnolls: AC: 5, Move: 9”, HD 2, Damage: 1-6 with longbow and 1-8 with morning star, HP: 11, 14, 13. Each of the gnolls have 3 SP and 6 GP on their persons.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="49" class="room">
		<p><strong>49) Gnoll Barracks:</strong> This is the actual lair of the gnolls in this section. There are sleeping provisions for 12 gnolls. Because they always have a guard posted, and being bloodthirsty creatures, they will always be ready for combat at a moment’s notice. There will always be 3 armed gnolls in this room, AC: 5, Move: 9”, HD: 2, Weapons: battle axe for 1-8 points of damage. Each of these gnolls will have 3 SP and 1 GP on its person.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="50" class="room">
		<p><strong>50) A Converted Crypt:</strong> This is an additional living space for the gnolls and for the most part it is filled with junk and litter. In this room will be the gnolls who fire the crossbows from the west wall into room 4 7. There are three of them. Each is armed with a light crossbow and a battle ax. If the door to this room is breached they will fire off their crossbows into the enemy and charge with their weapons.
		AC: 5, Move: 9”, HD: 2, Damage: crossbow 1-6, battle ax 1-8, HP 12, 8, 11. Each of these gnolls will have 2 SP and 4 GP on his person.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="51" class="room">
		**51) Another Converted Crypt:** This room will be exactly like room 50 except that the gnolls have the following: HP: 15 (he is the commander), 13, 9.
		</div>
		<div id="52" class="room">
		<p><strong>52) Lizard Men Barracks:</strong> This is of an allied troup of mercenary lizard men. They are under the command of the gnoll in room 51, but if things get rough they will break for it. 6 lizard men: AC: 4 (skin and shield), Move: 6”/12” (swimming), HD: 2 + 1, weapons: club for 1-8 damage and 4 darts each for 1-4, HP 8, 8, 7, 7, 11, 10. These lizard men will attempt to get back to their tribe. One of the lizards has recently discovered secret doors in the south wall of room 48 and there is a 40% chance that if that avenue of escape is possible they will use it. The 10 HP lizard man speaks the common tongue and may offer to ransom himself and the other lizard men with tales of great treasure (room 33) and directions on how to reach it. He won’t necessarily reveal any of the guardian creatures or traps unless magically forced to.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="53" class="room">
		<p><strong>53) The Rising Demon Image:</strong> This is the sculpture of a demon that rises up in flames into room 27 A. Its location is unknown to the locals. The statue is carved of black granite and has borne the ravages of time with a great deal of grace. Its eyes are large, 300 GP, faceted amber gemstones. Its mouth is hollow and an odor of methane is detectable from it. An odd quirk about this statue is that it will
		always turn and face (rotate in place) a good cleric, regardless of where he or she stands in the room. If there is more than one in the room, it will face the one of highest level. To the south of the room are a pair of hidden 10’ wide doors. They are covered over with plaster and faded frescoes are painted into the plaster, itself. To get at the door, the plaster must be chipped away. Behind the doors are stairs that lead downward. This complex is old; older than the Ancient Thracian tomb complexes of
		rooms 3 7-41. Their use was ended soon after the coming of the ancient Thracians. Some say that this is the remnant of an ancient race of civilized lizard men. No one can be certain, except that humans are not portrayed in any but the more recent frescoes and then only as sacrifices of lizard-headed men. The stairs are crumbly and deep with dust and fallen rubble. No plaster remains on the walls. The ceiling of the stairwell is covered with stalactites and the floor with stalagmites. In places they
		have grown together and almost blocked the passage. The dust on the floor is undisturbed.</div></p>
		<h3>Room Complex 53 A-J</h3>
		<div id="53a" class="room">
		<p><strong>53A) The Grand Temple of the Reptile Race:</strong> This vast hall was once the worship place for hundreds of highly intelligent lizard men who worshipped a supposedly immortal giant king. The floor is thick with dust, undisturbed except for a path that leads from the door of room 5 3G to the steps of the altar, where it seems that a creature of some kind has kneeled several times. This cavernous hall has long since fallen into ruin, time and moisture doing their work well. The ceiling is covered with stalactites that form occassional pillars as they meet with stalagmites thrusting up from the floor. The northwest corner has caved-in and it seems that many other places in the walls are weakening, also. Along each wall are a series of 4 doors. Along the east wall, the door to the south end of room 53F is sealed shut by the random formation of stalagmite pillars in front of it. The doors are great stone constructions, 10’ wide and 15’ tall. there is a 25% chance that any given set of doors will open freely (without great effort). If a door is stuck, it will be -2 on opening check for each door as it is encountered. On the west wall there are 4 doors, but they do not lead to places on this, the prime material plane.</p>
		<p>Door 1 leads to the Ethereal Plane. The door is wizard locked.</p>
		<p>Door 2 is blocked by stalagmite pillars and cannot be opened. Besides, it has lost the magic that once powered it.</p>
		<p>Door 3 leads to a small 1 0’ square room. That room is an extension of this plane into the astral plane. There a character may astrally leave his body without requiring the necessary spell. Players will be able to sense their astral selves ease of movement as though their astral bodies were continually flowing in and out of their prime material bodies. This door is wizard locked.</p>
		<p>Door 4 is, also, blocked by stalagmite columns. It, too, has lost the magic that once powered it and leads nowhere but into a stone wall.</p>
		<p>The stairs at the south end of the room lead upward 1 0’ to a ceremonial podium flanked by rotted tatters of an ancient tapestry, ruined beyond recognition. All that remains of the altar furniture is a crumbling marble podium and that, too, will tumble to marble dust if touched. In the south wall there are a pair of doors that are hidden from view by what remains of the drapes. Touching the curtains will powder them and the doors will be revealed.</p>
		</div><div id="53b" class="room">
		<p>53 B) A Ceremonial Chamber with a View: The original function of this chamber will be forever lost. But it can be determined that it was used to keep an eye on encroaching Humans during the waning of the Reptile race. The secret doors in the east wall are only secret to occupants of Room 41 B (see 41 B for that room’s contents). The 10’ x 10’ portal in the wall is 25’ above the level of Room 41 B’s floor. The walls of this room are covered with flaking plaster. Visible will be a few faded images of Reptile Men in jeweled robes and at least one picture of a gigantic winged Lizard Man. One valve of the south doors will be eternally jammed closed.</p>
		</div><div id="53c" class="room">
		<p>53C) Urns and Ashes: This small room is filled with shards of pottery and a few small, unbroken ceramic urns. The quality of the pottery is excellent and the 4 surviving pieces would be valued at 1000 GP each if taken to the right buyer (someone who is very interested in ancient, prehuman history). The urns seem to contain ashes of some sort. The secret door in the north wall is disguised by a glaze of stalactite material that has fom1ed over it and hidden the edges of the door.</p>
		</div><div id="53d" class="room">
		<p><strong>53D) A Preliminary Crypt:</strong> Two piles of dust and debris flank the north door in this toom. They are in actuality a pair of skeletal Lizard warriors who will spring to life if the room is entered, forming up right out of the dust. These Undead do not fear Human Clerics in the least, due to the special evil magic rings that they wear. Skeletal Lizard Men: AC: 5, Move: 6”, HD: 6, Damage: 1 - 10, HP: 32 each. <em>Protection from Evil</em> will keep these creatures at bay for 6 melee rounds and then they will actually shatter the spell with some sort of counter magic. When they are killed, they return to dust, as do their rings.</p>
		</div><div id="53e" class="room">
		<p><strong>53E) The Sepulcher of the Immortal King:</strong> This room is just as decayed and decrepit as the rest of the complex. However, sitting on a pedestle at the east end of the room is what appears to be a giant, mummified, dessicated hybrid of a gargoyle and a Lizard Man. If it stood, the creature would be 1 0’ tall with huge, parchment like bat wings springing from its scaly but withered back. The monster sits amongst its pile of treasure, unmoving and dead. If the room is entered the monster will slowly shift its head to face the intruders and it will be immediately apparent that its eyes are glowing malevolently. The monster is an incredibly ancient Lich: AC: 3, Move: 6”, HD: 12, Damage: 2 claws for 1 - 8 each, and a bite for 1 - 12, HP: 57, spells: <em>Charm Person, Hold Portal, Magic Missile (x2), Protection form Good, ESP, Invisibility, Levitate, Web, Wizard Lock, Dispel Magic, Fireball, Haste Spell, Slow Spell, Confusion (x2), Fear, Polymorph Others, Teleport (x2), Conjure Elemental, Cloud Kill, Death Spell, Invisible Stalker, Anti-Magic Shell, Delayed Blast Fireball</em>.</p>
		<p>His first probable action will be to <em>Teleport</em> to the altar in Room 53 A and summon an earth elemental to do his fighting for him. If the Rings in Room 53 D have been destroyed, he will be alerted and the spell will have been cast and he will be fading out. It is also probable that he will cast a <em>Haste Spell</em> upon himself to make sure that he can react faster than his opponents. Note that <em>Haste</em> does not increase the speed of spell casting. The Immortal King will avoid placing himself in any danger. Piled about the pedestle upon which the Immortal King sits are 5000 SP and 16,000 GP
		in loose piles, a lawful Red Dragon slaying Sword +2, a Potion of Fire Resistance and a Wand of Paralyzation.</p>
		<p>The west end of the room opens into a 1 0’ wide corridor that has been sealed off due to cave in.</p>
		</div><div id="53f" class="room">
		<p><strong>53F) Another Room of Unidentifiable Purpose:</strong> What this room once may have been is now unknown. The ceiling is covered with stalactites and the floor is littered with stalagmites, some of them blocking passage in the room. The narrow stair at the south end of the room leads upwards 25’ to Room 37. The door into that room is both secret and covered by ice making it detectable by 1 less point on a d6 (instead of an Elf locating the door on a d6 roll of 1 - 4 he will only be able to find it on a roll
		of 1 - 3).</p>
		</div><div id="53g" class="room">
		<p><strong>53G) A Makeshift Chapel:</strong> The footprints in the dust lead to this room. Upon entering the room, it will be immediately noticable that the dust on the floor has been swept away. The room looks as if someone or something has been maintaining it to some extent. There is not debris on the floor and it appears that a crude, man-shaped stick figure has been drawn in Ochre on the south wall. The figure seems to have wings and a tail. The chapel has been created and kept clean by the Shaman G’ruk of the Lizard Men in Room 31. He and only he has discovered the secret door in the north wall of their lair area. He has devoted this area to his private and secretive worship of the Immortal King, not knowing that it actually still lives.</p>
		</div><div id="53h" class="room">
		<p><strong>53H) Secret Lair of the Lizard Men Shaman:</strong> There is a 20% chance that G’ruk, Shaman of the Lizard people will be in this, his private lair (if he has already been killed in Room 31, then he will have 0% chance of appearing here). There is a pile of sleeping rags in one corner and a bag containing several strips of dried Human meat along with some glass beads and a few sharpened stone implements. There is nothing of real value in here. The stair to the south goes up a total of 75’ and eventually joins up with Room 31 .</p>

		<p><strong>53J) The Secret Sacrificial Shaft of the Lizard Priests:</strong> The frescoes in this room are intact also and show images of a giant winged Lizard Man (the Immortal King) devouring huge numbers of Humans, Lizard Men and Dinosaurs. Along the south wall, there is a 5’ square shaft for the sacrifice of living victims. The shaft is 45’ long but it opens up on the 3rd level for an additional drop of 200’ (2d6 of damage).</p>
